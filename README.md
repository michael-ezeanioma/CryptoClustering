# Overview 

Built with Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, K-Means, and hvPlot, this project applies clustering analysis to cryptocurrency market data using K-Means and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The project involves data preprocessing, scaling, clustering, and visualization to identify market trends and categorize cryptocurrencies based on their performance.

# Project Components

__1. Data Preprocessing:__
Loads crypto_market_data.csv into a Pandas DataFrame.
Retrieves summary statistics and visualizes initial trends.
Normalizes data using StandardScaler() from Scikit-Learn.
Creates a new DataFrame with the scaled data, setting "coin_id" as the index.

__2. Finding the Optimal k for Clustering:__
Uses the Elbow Method to determine the best number of clusters (k).
Iterates through k-values from 1 to 11 while computing inertia.
Plots an elbow curve to visually identify the optimal k.

__3. K-Means Clustering on Scaled Data:__
Initializes and fits a K-Means model with the optimal k.
Predicts clusters and adds the labels to a new column in the DataFrame.
Uses hvPlot to create a scatter plot:
X-axis: "price_change_percentage_24h"
Y-axis: "price_change_percentage_7d"
Color: Cluster labels
Hover Info: "coin_id"

__4. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:__
Reduces the dataset to three principal components using PCA.
Retrieves the explained variance to determine information retention.
Creates a new DataFrame with the PCA-transformed data while keeping "coin_id" as the index.

__5. Finding the Optimal k Using PCA Data:__
Repeats the Elbow Method on the PCA-reduced data.
Compares the optimal k from the PCA data with the original dataset.

__6. K-Means Clustering on PCA Data:__
Applies K-Means clustering to the PCA-transformed dataset.
Visualizes the results using an hvPlot scatter plot, setting:
X-axis: "PC1"
Y-axis: "PC2"
Color: Cluster labels
Hover Info: "coin_id"

__7. Comparing Results & Analysis:__
Compares clustering performance between original and PCA-reduced data.
Evaluates the impact of using fewer features for clustering.
Uses hvPlot to create a composite plot comparing elbow curves and clustering results.
